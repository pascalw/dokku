# Upgrading

This document covers upgrades for the 0.3.0 series and up. If upgrading from older versions, we recommend [a fresh install](/dokku/installation) on a new server.

> As of 0.3.18, dokku is installed by default via a debian package. Source-based installations are still available, though not recommended.
