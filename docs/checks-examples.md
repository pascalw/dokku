```

Following a deploy, dokku will now wait `10` seconds before routing traffic to the new container. If the container is not running after this time, then the deploy is failed and your old container will continue serving traffic. You can modify this value using the following command:

```shell
dokku config:set --global DOKKU_DEFAULT_CHECKS_WAIT=30
```

If your application needs a longer period to boot up - perhaps to load data into memory, or because of slow boot time - you may also use dokku's `checks` functionality to more precisely check whether an application can serve traffic or not.

To specify checks, add a `CHECKS` file to the root of your project directory. This is a text file with one line per check. Empty lines and lines starting with `#` are ignored.

> For dockerfile-based deploys, the file *must* be in `/app/CHECKS` within the container. `/app` is used by default as the root container directory for buildpack-based deploys.

A check is a relative URL and may be followed by expected content from the page, for example:

```
/about      Our Amazing Team
```

Dokku will wait `5` seconds before running the checks to give the server time to start. This value can be overridden on a per-app basis in the `CHECKS` file by setting `WAIT=nn`. You may also override this for the global dokku installation:

```shell
dokku config:set --global DOKKU_CHECKS_WAIT=15
```

Dokku will wait `60` seconds before stopping the old container so that existing connections are given a chance to complete. This value is also configurable globally:

```shell
dokku config:set --global DOKKU_WAIT_TO_RETIRE=120
```

> Note that during this time, multiple containers may be running on your server, which can be an issue for memory-hungry applications on memory-constrained servers.

Dokku will retry the checks `5` times until the checks are successful. If all 5 checks fail, the deployment is considered failed. This can be overridden in the `CHECKS` file by setting `ATTEMPTS=nn`. This number is also configurable globally:

```shell
dokku config:set --global DOKKU_CHECKS_ATTEMPTS=2
```

You can also choose to skip checks completely on a per-application basis:

```shell
dokku checks:disable APP
```

## Checks Examples

The CHECKS file may contain empty lines, comments (lines starting with #),
settings (NAME=VALUE) and check instructions.

The format of a check instruction is a path, optionally followed by the
expected content.  For example:

```
/                       My Amazing App
/stylesheets/index.css  .body
/scripts/index.js       $(function()
/images/logo.png
```

To check an application that supports multiple hostnames, use relative URLs
that include the hostname, for example:

```
//admin.example.com     Admin Dashboard
//static.example.com/logo.png
```

You can also specify the protocol to explicitly check HTTPS requests.


```
https://admin.example.com     Admin Dashboard
https://static.example.com/logo.png
```

The default behavior is to wait for 5 seconds before running the first check, and timeout each check to 30 seconds.

By default, checks will be attempted 5 times.  (Retried 4 times)

You can change these by setting `WAIT`, `TIMEOUT` and `ATTEMPTS` to different values, for
example:

```
WAIT=30     # Wait 1/2 minute
TIMEOUT=60  # Timeout after a minute
ATTEMPTS=10  # attempt checks 10 times

/                       My Amazing App
```

## Example: Successful Rails Deployment

In this example, a rails applicaiton is successfully deployed to dokku.  The initial round of checks fails while the server is starting, but once it starts they succeed and the deployment is successful. `ATTEMPTS` is set to 6, but the third attempt succeeds.

## Example: Failing Rails Deployment
In this example, a Rails application fails to deploy.  The reason for the failure is that the postgres database connection fails.  The initial checks will fail while we wait for the server to start up, just like in the above example.  However, once the server does start accepting connections, we will see an error 500 due to the postgres database connection failure.

Once the attempts have been exceeded, the deployment fails and we see the container output, which shows the Postgres connection errors.
